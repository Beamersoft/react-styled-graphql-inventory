# React Styled Graphql Inventory

![React Styled Graphql Inventory](./assets/logo.webp)

This project showcases a dynamic and scalable way to build modern web applications using React and Apollo Client. It leverages the power of GraphQL for efficient data fetching and manipulation, combined with the elegance of Styled Components for styling, to create a visually appealing and responsive user interface.

At its core, the project demonstrates the integration of Apollo Client within a React application, enabling state management that is both powerful and easy to maintain. It features custom hooks, such as useStateWithStorage, which enhances the React state management by persisting state across page reloads using localStorage, providing a seamless user experience.

"react-styled-graphql-inventory" is designed as a practical example of how to structure a project for real-world applications, emphasizing code organization, testing with Jest, and advanced React patterns. Whether for an e-commerce site or a data-driven dashboard, this project serves as a template for developers looking to implement GraphQL in their React applications with an emphasis on clean design and maintainable code.

This template uses the Vendure's API: https://www.vendure.io/docs/graphql-api/shop/
